This is the provided code for COMP621 assignment 2.

There are two examples:

* The one in natlab.cs621.instrumentation instruments an input program
  to count and display the number of assignments it makes at runtime.
* The one in natlab.cs621.analysis is a simple reaching defs analysis.
  (It doesn't handle: global variables, persistent variables, function
   parameters, and nested functions.)

You can build the code by running "ant". This generates two scripts:

* profile-assignments.sh takes in matlab files and writes out the
instrumented code in the "instrumented/" directory. (This directory is
deleted and recreated it each time it's run.)

e.g. ./profile-assignments.sh f1.m f2.m

* analyze-reaching-defs.sh takes in matlab files and prints out analysis
results for each function/script to standard output.

e.g. ./analyze-reaching-defs.sh f1.m f2.m > results.txt
